ðŸ§± OOP with Python â€” Practice Projects
A collection of hands-on projects to explore and reinforce object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python. These projects focus on real-world simulations using classes, methods, inheritance, properties, and more.
ðŸš€ Projects
Tetris Shape Generator
A Python program that creates the classic Tetris shapes â€” I, O, J, L, S, Z, T â€” using object-oriented design.
Utilizes the turtle, random, and itertools libraries to visualize and manage the shapes.
Future updates will include rotation logic and possibly new custom shapes.
Traffic Light Simulation
A learning project to simulate a traffic light system using classes and methods.
Demonstrates core OOP features such as enumeration, property decorators, and inheritance.
