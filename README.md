ðŸ§± ##OOP with Python â€” Practice Projects

1. **Tetris Shape Generator**  
   A Python program that creates the classic Tetris shapes â€” **I, O, J, L, S, Z, T** â€” using object-oriented design.  
   Utilizes the `turtle`, `random`, and `itertools` libraries to visualize and manage the shapes.  
   Future updates will include **rotation logic** and possibly new custom shapes.

2. **Traffic Light Simulation**  
   A learning project to simulate a **traffic light system** using classes and methods.  
   Demonstrates core OOP features such as **enumeration**, **property decorators**, and **inheritance**.
