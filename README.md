# OOP-python
A practice project in object-oriented programming using Python.
This project focuses on creating the classic Tetris shapes — I, O, J, L, S, Z, T — using classes and methods. It makes use of the turtle, random, and itertools libraries to visualize and manage the shapes.
Future updates will include shape rotations and potentially new variations of Tetris pieces.
